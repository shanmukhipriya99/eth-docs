## What is cryptocurrency?
It is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger.

## What is Ether?
Ether is a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain and can be used for many things on the Ethereum network. After the Merge, ether is required to validate and propose blocks on the Mainnet.

## Minting Ether
Minting is the process in which new ether gets created on the Ethereum ledger. Ether is minted as a reward for each block proposed and at every epoch checkpoint by the underlying Ethereum protocol.

## Burning Ether
Ether can be destroyed through a process called 'burning'. When the ether gets burned, it gets removed from circulation permanently.

When users pay for their transactions, a base gas fee, set by the network according to transactional demand, gets destroyed.
Burning the base fee hinders a block producer's ability to manipulate transactions. For example, if block producers received the base fee, they could include their own transactions for free and raise the base fee for everyone else.

#### Wei is the smallest possible amount of ether

Each transaction on Ethereum contains a value field specifying the amount of ether to be transferred, denominated in wei, to send from the sender's address to the recipient address.

When the recipient address is a smart contract, this transferred ether may be used to pay for gas when it executes its code.

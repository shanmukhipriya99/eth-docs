## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a chain of blocks that are cryptographically connected, where each block contains some immutable data.
This data is primarily transactions that take place within the blockchain.
These transactions are grouped and put in a block. A consensus mechanism decides whether this block is accepted into the current chain.
The longest chain of blocks is the main blockchain.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain with a computer embedded in it. This computer is called the *Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)*. Everyone in the Ethereum network, i.e., every node in the ethereum network, agrees upon the state of the EVM and keeps a copy. Any participant can request the EVM to perform a computation, and whenever such a request is broadcasted, the other participants on the network verify, validate, and execute this computation. The execution of this computation causes a state change in the EVM, and so this change is broadcasted throughout the network for everyone to update the state of their copy.

The requests for computations are called transaction requests, and a record of all these transactions, including the EVM's current state, is stored on the blockchain, which is agreed upon by all the nodes and stored with them.

Cryptographic mechanisms ensure none of the transactions can be tampered with once they are executed and added to the blockchain. They also ensure all the transactions are signed and executed with appropriate permissions.

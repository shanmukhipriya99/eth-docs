## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a chain of blocks that are cryptographically connected to each other, where each block contains some immutable data.
This data is primarily transactions that take place within the blockchain.
These transactions are grouped together and put in a block. A consensus mechanism is used to decide whether this block is accepted into the current chain.
The longest chain of blocks is the main blockchain.
